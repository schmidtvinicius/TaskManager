## Task Manager

This is a web application I designed for my 'Web Applications' class during my first year. The objective of this application is to help people manage 'task lists' within different categories. Each task list contains a number of tasks that can be divided into three different statuses: 'To do', 'Doing' and 'Done'. Furthermore each task can have a due date. The categories and task lists can be managed by the owner of those. The owner can also add members to the task lists, so that they can work together on the task list. 

## Things I've learned with this project:

* How to use the 'Flexbox' and 'Media queries' CSS features to make more responsive web pages;
* How to make dynamic webpages using Thymeleaf conditionals and loops to display data from the model;
* How to manage user sessions;
* Basics of cookies;
